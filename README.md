Kong-To-APISIX is a migration tool helping you migrate configuration data of your API gateway from Kong to Apache APISIX. It aims to help people to dip their toes in APISIX and also reduce the operations cost.

Only tested with APISIX 2.8 and Kong 2.4 for now.

## How to use

1. Dump Kong Configuration with `Deck` or `CLI`, for detailed usage, please refer to:
   - Kong Deck : https://docs.konghq.com/deck/1.7.x/guides/backup-restore/
   - Kong CLI Config Export: https://docs.konghq.com/gateway-oss/2.4.x/cli/#kong-config

2. Build `Kong to APISIX`, go version require `1.16+`ã€‚

3. Run Kong-To-APISIX, and it would generate `apisix.yaml` as declarative configuration file for APISIX.

   ```shell
   $ make build
   $ ./bin/kong-to-apisix migrate -i kong.yaml -o apisix.yaml
   migrate succeed
   ```

4. Configure APISIX with `apisix.yaml`, see https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/stand-alone for details.
